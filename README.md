# Map Maker Project

I created a 2D-game sprite-based map maker from scratch a couple years ago that allows you to save maps in progress and export finished maps as PNG image files.

Features:

- **Select Map Size and Sprite Size**

You can choose the dimensions of your map (ex. 30x30 sprites) as well as the dimensions of the sprites you would like to use (default is 32x32 pixels.)


- **Import Sprites/Spritesheets**

You can import sprites of your specified dimensions or import spritesheets that will automatically be sliced into the individual sprites and be added to your palette of sprites.


- **Load/Save Map**

You can save maps in progress as .mbd files. These can be opened later to continue where you left off.


- **Export Map**

Once you finish creating your map, you can export it as a .PNG


- **Extend/Cut the Map**

You can add columns or rows if you find you originally made the dimensions too small. There is also an autocrop feature if your map is too small for the dimensions you selected, which will automatically crop unused rows and columns outside the range of the map.


- **Zoom**

You can zoom in 25% increments from 25% to 200% in order to help you preview what your final map may look like if it gets resized in a game.
